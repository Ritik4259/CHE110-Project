                <p class="oview">Land resources are the components of the natural land unit that can be used to meet human needs. They include the physical,
                    biotic, environmental, infrastructural, and socio-economic components of the land unit, as well as the surface and near-surface 
                    freshwater resources important for management.Land resources mean the resources available from the land, thus the agricultural 
                    land which contain natural fertilizer for growth of the products sown; the underground water, the various minerals like coal, bauxite, 
                    gold and other raw materials.Land resource refers to the land available for exploitation, like non agricultural lands for buildings, developing townships etc
                    Land resources (natural resources) (economically referred to as land or raw materials) occur naturally within environments that exist relatively undisturbed by mankind, in a natural form.                   
                    A natural resource is often characterized by amounts of biodiversity existent in various ecosystems.
                    Natural resources are derived from the environment. Many of them are essential for our survival while others are used for satisfying our wants
                    Natural resources may be further classified in different ways.Underground geological resources (oil, gas, ores, precious metals), and
                    Deeper geohydrological resources that normally bear no relation to the surface topography such as confined aquifers, are excluded from the group of
                    components of the natural land unit, although it is recognized that some countries consider them as part of individual land ownership (and hence 
                    with rights to exploit or sell them).</p>
              <div class="b">
                <h2>Types of Land Resources</h2>
                <p>Land resources can be classified into many types. Few of the types are as below:</p>
                <h3>Agricultural Land</h3>
                <img class="rimg" src="https://www.nobroker.in/blog/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Capital-Gains-on-Sale-of-Agricultural-Land-1-1.jpg" alt="agri land" height="300px" width="300px">
                <p>
                    Agricultural land is a type of land resource that is used for growing crops or raising livestock. It is an essential resource for 
                    human survival, as it provides us with food, fiber, and other essential products. Agricultural land is typically characterized by 
                    fertile soil, a suitable climate for crop growth, and access to water for irrigation.
                    Agricultural land is an essential resource for human survival. It provides us with food, fiber, and other essential products. It 
                    is also a source of employment for millions of people around the world. Sustainable agricultural land management is essential to 
                    ensure that this valuable resource is available for future generations.
                    Agricultural land is essential for human survival and well-being. It provides us with food, fiber, and other agricultural products. 
                    Agricultural land also plays an important role in the environment, as it helps to regulate the climate, protect water resources, and 
                    support biodiversity.
                </p>
                <h3>Grasslands</h3>
                <img class="limg" src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/97/fa/21/97fa21c18930ebe7fea65f2c4fcb8cb6.jpg" alt="grassland" width="300px" height="300px">
                <p>
                    Grasslands are areas where the vegetation is dominated by grasses. They occur naturally on all continents except Antarctica and 
                    are found in most ecoregions of the Earth. 
                    Grasslands are characterized by their relatively low precipitation and high winds. These conditions make it difficult for trees 
                    and other woody plants to survive, but they are ideal for grasses. Grasses are able to withstand drought and wind, and they can 
                    grow quickly to recover from grazing and other disturbances.
                    Grasslands are home to a variety of wildlife, including grazing animals such as bison, cattle, and sheep, as well as predators 
                    such as wolves, coyotes, and hawks. Grasslands also provide habitat for a variety of insects, reptiles, and birds.
                    Grasslands are important for a variety of reasons. They provide food for grazing animals, which are a source of food and other 
                    products for humans. Grasslands also play an important role in the global carbon cycle. Grasslands store carbon in their soils, 
                    which helps to mitigate climate change. Grasslands also provide important ecosystem services such as flood control, water filtration, 
                    and erosion prevention.
                </p>
                <h3>Forests</h3>
                <img class="rimg" src="https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs41477-019-0374-3/MediaObjects/41477_2019_374_Figa_HTML.jpg" alt=""forest height="300px" width="300px">
                <p>
                    Forests are areas where the vegetation is dominated by trees. They are found on all continents except Antarctica and cover 
                    about 31% of the Earth's land surface.
                    The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations defines a forest as land that spans more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent.
                    Forests are complex ecological systems that contain a variety of other organisms, such as other plants and animals.
                    Forests differ in composition and structure. These are both affected by biotic (e.g., animals, plants, humans) and abiotic (e.g., soil, moisture, sunlight, climate) factors.
                    Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass.
                    More than one-third of the world's population has a close dependence on forests and forest products.
                    Forests are nature's most efficient ecosystem, with a high rate of photosynthesis affecting both plant and animal systems.
                </p>
                <h3>Wetland</h3>
                <img class="limg" src="https://cdn.britannica.com/12/83412-050-920ED168/Okavango-delta-Botswana.jpg" alt="wetland" height="300px" width="300px">
                <p>
                    wetlands are a land resource. Wetlands are areas of land that are either covered with water or saturated with water. They are 
                    considered a resource because they provide useful products, such as peat, and perform valued functions, such as water purification 
                    and carbon storage.
                    Wetlands support huge biodiversity.Wetlands play an important role in the hydrological cycle.Wetlands act as a kidney for controlling floods.
                    \Wetlands play a major role in human diet and nutrition
                    Wetlands support livelihood and income generation to people residing nearby.
                    A wide variety of species live in wetlands. Birds, including ducks, geese, kingfishers, and sandpipers, use wetlands as pit stops during long
                    migrations, providing them with protection and food. Mammals like otters, beavers, and even tigers rely on wetlands to find food and shelter.
                    And, of course, wetlands are home to many types of fish.
                    The West Siberian Lowland, Amazon River Basin, and Hudson Bay Lowland are among the largest wetlands in the world. The world’s largest
                    protected wetland is Llanos de Moxos, located in Bolivia. It is more than 17 million acres—roughly equal in size to North Dakota. 
                </p>
                <h2>Deserts</h2>
                <p>
                Deserts cover more than one-fifth of the Earth's land area, and they are found on every continent. A place that receives less than 10 inches (25 centimeters) of rain per year is considered a desert. Deserts are part of a wider class of regions called drylands. These areas exist under a “moisture deficit,” which means they can frequently lose more moisture through evaporation than they receive from annual precipitation.Deserts can be classified mainly into two types: Hot Deserts and Cold Deserts
                </p>
                <h4>Hot deserts</h4>
                <img class="rimg" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTtN79cEBp2a8cI6qBrgvMiO-VFdj0-_P6kMw&usqp=CAU">
                <p>
                  Hot deserts are areas of the Earth’s surface that receive less than 25cm or 10 inches of rainfall yearly. Deserts are part of a broader class of regions called drylands. Dryland areas are under a “moisture deficit,” meaning they can frequently lose more moisture through evaporation than they receive from annual precipitation.
                  The largest hot desert in the world is northern Africa’s Sahara, where daytime temperatures can reach up to 50°C (122°F). Only around 20% of deserts are covered in sand.
                  Hot deserts have an extreme climate and challenging environment. There is very little biodiversity in hot deserts because of the harsh climate. Few species are specialised enough to survive there. Plants and animals which do survive there have adapted to difficult conditions.The biotic or living components and the abiotic or non-living components of the hot desert rely on one another - a change in one will lead to a change in the other.
                </p>
                <h4>Cold deserts</h4>
                <img class="limg" src="https://images.travelandleisureasia.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2023/10/10192115/antartica-1-1600x900.jpeg?tr=w-600,pr-true">
                
                <p>
                  Cold desert, any large arid area of land that typically receives scant amounts of annual precipitation, which occurs mainly in the form of snow or fog. (The upper limit of mean annual precipitation is often considered to be fewer than 25 cm [9.8 inches]; however, sources vary)Cold deserts are arid habitats with low rainfall and cold winters and hot summers. They are found at higher latitudes than tropical and subtropical deserts, such as in the Arctic, Antarctica, Greenland, Iran, Turkestan, Northern, and Western China. The weather and soil in cold deserts are not suitable for plant growth.Cold deserts are found typically in temperate regions at high elevations, on plateaus, or in mountainous areas; however, they also occur in polar regions. Shrubs and grasses are the main types of vegetation, and most plants and other organisms have adaptations that enable them to survive the dry, frigid conditions. Cold deserts are located at higher latitudes than deserts situated in tropical and subtropical climates, and thus they experience colder temperatures, especially in the winter. They are found in Central Asia, western North America, southeastern South America, Antarctica, and the Arctic.
                </p>
                <h2>Land Resource Management</h2>
                <p>
                  Land resource management is a field that focuses on the management of land resources in a sustainable manner. The field involves 
                  using economic, legal, and administrative means to keep land resources in good condition. This program aims to provide the student 
                  with basic knowledge about land management, as well as basic skills and abilities for management. 
                  There are many challenges in land management. One of the most urgent concerns is reversing the process of desertification and land 
                  degradation. These problems impact millions of people around the world and pose threats to their food and livelihood security. However, 
                  many tools and methods are available to reverse these trends. These tools should incorporate both biophysical and economic aspects in 
                  order to effectively manage lands.</p>
                  <h3>Sustainable land management </h3>
                  <p>
                  Sustainable land management (SLM) focuses on the efficient use of scarce resources while preserving the environment. This requires 
                  identifying and measuring a suite of indicators, which is useful for decision-makers and task managers. These indicators may include 
                  land quality, land use intensity, land cover, biodiversity, and nutrient balance. They can be used to assess the performance of individual 
                  projects and assess the trend toward sustainability. 
                  This approach focuses on rehabilitation and preventive maintenance of the environment and integrates biophysical and socio-economic data. It also includes 
                  an interdisciplinary approach and methodology.

                <h2>Global Land Resources Issues</h2>
                <p>
                  Global land resources issues encompass a wide range of environmental, social, and economic challenges related to the use and management of land. Here are some key issues:
                </p>
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                  Land Degradation: Land degradation, including soil erosion, desertification, and deforestation, threatens the productivity and sustainability of agricultural and natural ecosystems.
                    </li>

                <h2>Major Land Resources Issue in India</h2>
                <p>
                  Land resources in India are faced with multiple issues that lead to a decline in their productivity. The causes are both environmental and related to malpractices. The main environmental issues confronting Indian resources are:
                  <ol>
                    <li>
                      Low productivity: The yield of the crops in the country is low in comparison to the international level. Indian agriculture is also very low in comparison to the international level. The vast rainfed areas of the country, particularly drylands, which mostly grow coarse cereals, pulses, and oilseeds, have very low yields.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Degradation of Cultivable Land: One of the serious problems that arise out of faulty strategy of irrigation and
                      agricultural development is the degradation of land resources. It leads to depletion of soil fertility. In irrigated areas, a large tract of agricultural land lost its fertility due to alkalization and salinization of soils and waterlogging. Excessive use of chemicals such as insecticides and pesticides has led to their concentration in toxic amounts in the soil profile. Leguminous crops have been displaced from the cropping pattern in the irrigated areas and the duration of fallow has substantially reduced owing to multiple cropping. This has obliterated the process of natural fertilization such as nitrogen. fixation. Rainfed areas also experience degradation of several types like soil erosion by water and wind erosion which are often induced by human activities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Land Fragmentation: In India, land holdings are often small and fragmented, which makes it challenging to implement modern farming techniques and limits the income potential of small-scale farmers.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Land Acquisition and Displacement: Land acquisition for infrastructure development and industrial projects has led to conflicts, as it often involves the displacement of communities without adequate compensation or rehabilitation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Illegal Land Encroachment: Unauthorized occupation of public or forest land, often by informal settlements, is a significant issue, affecting land use planning and environmental conservation.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Urbanization: Rapid urbanization in India is leading to the conversion of agricultural land into urban areas, raising concerns about food security, habitat loss, and natural resource depletion.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Land Ownership and Land Records: Land ownership disputes, unclear land titles, and outdated land records contribute to legal and administrative challenges in managing land resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Land Use Planning: India lacks comprehensive land use planning and zoning regulations, which can lead to haphazard development and inefficiencies in land use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Forest Conservation: Conservation of forest land and biodiversity is essential, as deforestation and illegal logging continue to threaten India's natural resources.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      Land Policy and Reforms: Land reforms are necessary to address issues related to land distribution, tenancy, and land rights, with the aim of ensuring equitable access to land resources.
                    </li>
                  </ol>
                  <p>To address these issues, the Indian government and various stakeholders are working on policies and initiatives aimed at sustainable land management, improving land records, and addressing land tenure issues. Efforts are also being made to balance economic development with environmental conservation and social equity.</p>

                <h2>Land Resource Conservation</h2>
                <p>
                  The preservation of land assets is the security of standard land assets. This is accomplished by wiping out or palliative the human 
                  result on auto chthonic habitats, the capable assembling of land assets, furthermore preservation that means to show around human hurt 
                  to land assets. Accordingly, this pace of debasement of land should be checked. conversion, land recovery, managed use of substance chemicals 
                  and manures, and minds overgrazing area unit a little of the conventional ways accustomed save land assets. The developing public and their steady 
                  developing interest have prompted an enormous scope annihilation of timber cowl and productive land and has created a sense of dread toward 
                  losing this traditional plus.<br>
                  Conservation of land resources is the sustainable use and management of land resources. It includes the conservation of soil, water, 
                  plants, and animals. Conservation of land resources helps to protect the environment and to ensure that there is enough food and water 
                  for future generations.
                  There are many ways to conserve land resources. One way is to reduce or stop the use of harmful chemicals. This can be done by using organic farming 
                  methods, using less water for irrigation, or using more efficient irrigation methods. Another way to conserve land resources is to prevent or reduce 
                  soil erosion. This can be done by planting trees or shrubs on steep slopes, terracing fields, or by using mulch. Still another way to conserve land 
                  resources is to reduce deforestation. This can be done by planting trees in areas that have been deforested, protecting natural forests, or by reforestation.
                  The best way to conserve land resources is to use them wisely and responsibly. We can all do our part to help conserve land resources by being aware of the ways we impact the environment and making choices that will help protect it.

                <h3>Need for Conservation of Land Resources</h3>
                <p>
                  It is estimated that humans have impacted over 60% of the world’s land surface. With the world’s population projected to increase by 2 billion 
                  people by 2050, the need for the conservation of land resources has never been greater. The demand for food, water, and energy will continue 
                  to rise, putting even more pressure on our limited land resources.
                  So what can be done to conserve land resources? One solution is to improve efficiency in agriculture, which currently uses 70% of the 
                  world’s land surface. This can be done through a variety of methods such as precision agriculture, no-till farming, and agroforestry. 
                  Another solution is to set aside more land for nature conservation. This can be done through initiatives such as rewilding and creating 
                  protected areas.
                  Both individuals and governments have a role to play in conserving land resources. Everyone can help by reducing their consumption of meat 
                  and dairy products (which require large amounts of land for grazing and crop production), choosing products made from sustainable materials 
                  (such as bamboo or recycled plastic), and supporting initiatives to protect natural habitats. Governments can help by implementing policies 
                  that encourage sustainable land use practices and investing in research and development for new technologies that help us live more sustainably 
                  on this planet.
                </p>
                <h3>Importance of Conservation of Land Resources</h3>
                <p>
                  It is important to conserve land resources for a variety of reasons. First, the land is a finite resource, meaning that there is a limited amount of it available on Earth. Second, land resources provide essential ecosystem services, such as food production, water filtration, and flood control. Third, the conservation of land resources can help mitigate the effects of climate change. Fourth, healthy ecosystems are necessary for human health and well-being. Finally, land resources are key to the economic development of countries and regions.
                  The first reason to conserve land resources is that they are finite. There is only so much land available on Earth, and it is not possible to create more. This means that if we want to maintain our current standard of living, we need to use the land wisely and conserve it for future generations.
                  Second, land resources provide essential ecosystem services without which humans could not survive. These services include food production, water filtration, and flood control. Ecosystems also provide other benefits such as recreation and tourism opportunities and carbon sequestration.
                  Third, the conservation of land resources can help mitigate the effects of climate change by preserving or increasing carbon sinks such as forests. Additionally, healthy ecosystems are more resilient to climate change impacts such as floods and droughts. Fourth, human health depends on healthy ecosystems. For example, many people get their drinking water from rivers or aquifers that are recharged by forested watersheds.
