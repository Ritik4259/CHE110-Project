        <p>Land resources research in EVS (Environmental Studies) encompasses a broad range of investigations aimed at understanding, managing, and conserving land resources for sustainable development. It involves interdisciplinary approaches drawing from various fields such as soil science, ecology, forestry, agriculture, geography, and environmental policy.</p>
    <h1>Land use and land cover change</h1>
    <p>
        Land use and land cover change (LULC) is the process of converting land from one use to another. This can happen naturally, such as when a forest is converted to grassland due to climate change. However, it is more often caused by human activities, such as deforestation for agriculture or urbanization. 
    </p>
    <img src="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/50235189/figure/fig1/AS:669994371256325@1536750514396/Methodology-for-land-use-cover-change-Detection.png" alt="flow-chart" class="chart">
    <p>
        LULC is a major environmental concern because it can have a significant impact on the environment. For example, deforestation can lead to soil erosion, loss of biodiversity, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Urbanization can lead to habitat loss, water pollution, and air pollution.

        <h1>Environmental impact assessments</h1>
        <p>Environmental impact assessments (EIAs) are a systematic process of evaluating the potential environmental impacts of a proposed project, development, or policy. EIAs are used to identify and assess the positive and negative impacts of a project on a variety of environmental resources, including air and water quality, soil, vegetation, wildlife, and human health.</p>
        <p>Data and statistics play an important role in EIAs. Data is used to describe the existing environmental conditions at a project site, while statistics are used to analyze the potential impacts of a project on these conditions. Some of the data and statistical methods commonly used in EIAs include: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Descriptive statistics: Descriptive statistics are used to summarize the existing environmental conditions at a project site. This can include measures of central tendency, such as the mean and median, as well as measures of dispersion, such as the range and standard deviation. </li>
            <li>Inferential statistics: Inferential statistics are used to draw conclusions about the population based on a sample of data. This can be used to determine whether a project is likely to have a statistically significant impact on the environment. </li>
